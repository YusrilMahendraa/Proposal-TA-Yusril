  abstract = {Tujuan utama dari penelitian ini adalah merancang model pengembangan dashboard untuk kebutuhan perguruan tinggi. Dashboard adalah aplikasi sistem informasi yang menyajikan informasi mengenai indikator utama dari aktifitas organisasi secara sekilas dalam layar tunggal. Pembuatan model memperhatikan 3(tiga) aspek utama dashboard yaitu penyajian data/informasi, personalisasi, dan kolaborasi antar pengguna. Model yang dihasilkan digunakan untuk pengembangan dashboard bagi kebutuhan monitoring dan evaluasi kinerja perguruan tinggi. Monitoring dan evaluasi kinerja mutlak dilakukan secara terus menerus oleh perguruan tinggi untuk memastikan bahwa proses bisnis yang dijalankannya dapat mencapai tujuan yang telah ditetapkan, melalui strategi pengelolaan yang tepat. Metode penelitian yang digunakan adalah studi literatur dan survei kuesioner. Studi literatur dilakukan untuk membuat rancangan awal model. Sedangkan survei kuesioner dilakukan untuk mengidentifikasi kebutuhan calon pengguna dashboard dan mengetahui faktor-faktor yang yang mempengaruhi kesuksesan pengembangan sistem informasi di perguruan tinggi. Jumlah responden sebanyak 95 orang di lingkungan Universitas Airlangga (UA) dan Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB). Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa terdapat perbedaan prioritas kebutuhan dashboard untuk pengguna di UA dan ITB. Namun secara umum dapat dinyatakan bahwa kebutuhan yang terkait aspek penyajian data/informasi, personalisai, dan performansi merupakan hal yang dianggap penting untuk sebuah dashboard. Sedangkan aspek kolaborasi hanya dianggap sebagai daya tarik dashboard. Model pengembangan dashboard yang dihasilkan menggambarkan bahwa kepuasan pengguna dipengaruhi oleh kualitas sistem, kualitas layanan, dan manfaat positif yang diberikan oleh sistem.},

  abstract = {Reporting academic data to the Pangkalan Data Pendidikan Tinggi (PDDIKTI) is a mandatory requirement for higher education institutions to ensure the validity and synchronization of student, lecturer, course, and academic activity data. However, in practice, several challenges arise, such as discrepancies between the internal academic system (Siakad) and the Feeder PDDIKTI, delays in reporting, and difficulties in monitoring synchronization status in real-time. This study aims to develop an academic data reporting monitoring dashboard based on a Data Mart, enabling efficient and centralized monitoring of academic data synchronization. The dashboard integrates data from Feeder PDDIKTI and Siakad through the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to generate accurate and easily interpretable information. The findings indicate that the developed dashboard effectively visualizes academic data synchronization status in real-time, reduces reporting errors, and accelerates the validation process before submission to PDDIKTI. Thus, this dashboard serves as an effective solution to support academic data governance in higher education institutions.},

  abstract = {University management requires accurate and fast academic reports that make it easier to make strategic decisions and in order to improve the quality of education. Therefore we need a tool that can monitor, evaluate and measure the performance of universities. A common problem is that there is a lot of academic data stored but to present it in reports at the time of evaluating academic activities is difficult and takes a long time. Academic evaluation can be presented with a dashboard so that it becomes easy for decision making. Dashboard is a page that shows graphs as KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) of an organization and provides all the important measurements needed to make key executive decision making. Universities in Indonesia report data on students, lecturers and lecture activities to the PDDIKTI (Higher Education Database). The data contained in the PDDIKTI Feeder is made an academic Dashboard in the form of visualization to assist and support decision making at the academic level and also to monitor using KPI as an evaluation. With the existence of an academic dashboard based on KPI, the presentation of reports becomes faster and easier to understand because it is in the form of visuals and indicators to find out what things need to be improved and the extent to which the achievements of each academic component are used as benchmarks in submitting study program accreditation.},

  abstract = {Higher education institutions often face a number of challenges in managing data and reporting information effectively, such as limited availability and distribution of information. This also happened in the Industrial Engineering Study Program at Sebelas Maret University (PSTI UNS). PSTI UNS needs a performance monitoring platform for study programs in the field of student and graduate affairs to support study program management and quality assurance activities. The information system currently provided by UNS is not yet able to complete PSTI's needs for monitoring and quality assurance functions at the study program level. A solution that has been proven to be able to solve similar problems is through the use of an information dashboard or dashboard. The unavailability of dashboards and PSTI's urgent need for study program performance monitoring activities led this research to design a dashboard in accordance with PSTI's needs and ensure that the design developed could be used immediately. To ensure the success of the design, this research uses a user-centric method in the design process and heuristic usability testing as an evaluation stage. This research produced a dashboard design, data filling template, and a guidebook that was used to make dashboard use easier. The successfully designed dashboard has more complete study program level information from the information system provided by UNS and has succeeded in meeting the needs of PSTI users with a user satisfaction level of 7.6. Based on the level of implementation readiness, this dashboard scored 86.83\% for its usability test with minor problems. The root of the problem identified has been found and repaired.},

  abstract = {The Ministry of Higher Education, Science, and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia is responsible for monitoring the Academic Workload (BKD) of lecturers across universities. However, the existing BKD data management system faces challenges in data visualization, feature limitations, and suboptimal user experience, which hinder efficiency in reporting and decision-making. This study develops and optimizes the BKD Dashboard within the Integrated Resource Information System (SISTER) using the SCRUM methodology over seven sprints, focusing on enhancing data visualization, integrating a graph download feature, and refining the user interface for improved usability. The evaluation, conducted using the paired t-test and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), demonstrated a significant efficiency improvement from 75\% to 92.5\%, with contributions distributed across data visualization (40\%), feature enhancements (35\%), and user experience improvements (25\%). Additionally, a user satisfaction survey resulted in an average score of 4.5 out of 5, indicating a high level of acceptance and usability among stakeholders. These findings confirm that SCRUM-based development not only enhances the technical efficiency of academic information systems but also strengthens data-driven decision-making in higher education management. This research contributes to the advancement of adaptive, user-centered information systems by providing a scalable model for dashboard optimization in academic settings. Future research should explore the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) for predictive analytics, long-term system testing, and broader system interoperability to further enhance functionality and scalability.},

The Faculty of Information Technology at Tarumanagara University currently offers two study programs: Informatics Engineering and Information Systems. While Tarumanagara University already has a system for managing student data, it requires further development to remain competitive with other universities, particularly those offering information technology programs. The existing system provides only basic information, such as whether the number of students this year has increased or decreased compared to the previous year. However, it lacks the ability to deliver a comprehensive overview of student data. To address this limitation, a monitoring system is needed to provide more accurate and systematic information. This system will be visualized in the form of a dashboard, offering insights into trends such as the number of students, their school origins, gender distribution, and address/region of origin. The dashboard design is based on the waterfall model of the software development life cycle (SDLC) and is developed using Power BI Desktop.},
