  abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic period, all the Sri Lankan universities delivered lectures in fully online mode using Virtual Learning Environments. In fully online mode, students cannot track their performance level, their progress in the course, and their performances compared to the rest of the class. This paper presents research work conducted at the University of Colombo School of Computing (UCSC), Sri Lanka, to solve the above problems and facilitate students learning in fully online and blended learning environments using Learning Analytics. The research objective is to design and create a Technology Enhanced Learning Analytics (TELA) dashboard for improving students’ motivation, engagement, and grades. The Design Science research strategy was followed to achieve the objectives of the research. Initially, a literature survey was conducted analyzing features and limitations in current Learning Analytic dashboards. Then, current Learning Analytic plugins for Moodle were studied to identify their drawbacks. Two surveys with 136 undergraduate students and interviews with 12 lecturers were conducted to determine required features of the TELA system. The system was designed as a Moodle Plugin. Finally, an evaluation of the system was done with third-year undergraduate students of the UCSC. The results showed that the TELA dashboard can improve students' motivation, engagement, and grades. As a result of the system, students could track their current progress and performance compared to the peers, which helps to improve their motivation to engage more in the course. Also, the increased engagement in the course enhances the student’s selfconfidence since the student can see continuous improvement of his/her progress and performance which in turn improves the student’s grades.},

  abstract = {This study aims to explore the information disclosure level of universities in Indonesia and~its relationship with university ranking. Data were collected from universities’ reportspublished in their website from 2018 to 2020 (53 Observations). Using content analysis and~regression tests, this study found a low level of information disclosure in universities in~Indonesia. The disclosure of sustainability aspect is the lowliest level (9\%) compared to the~other information disclosures. The intellectual capital disclosure is not explicitly stated in~the universities’ reports. The results of the regression test confirmed that the universities’~ranking have a positive effect on the universities’ disclosure level. The study supports the~applicability of the signal theory in the context of higher education institutions.},
